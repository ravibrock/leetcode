# LeetCode
Contains my successful LeetCode submissions, synced daily by [this action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/leetcode-sync) (that I contributed to :D). My personal configuration is in `.github/workflows/sync_leetcode.yml`, and the action's description has detailed setup instructions.

## Steps to get started:
1. Create repo
2. Add `CSRFTOKEN` and `LEETCODE_SESSION` secrets
3. Give Actions read/write permissions
4. Run action manually without the cleanup step
5. Add cleanup step to the action's workflow file
6. Let it run on its own as usual
